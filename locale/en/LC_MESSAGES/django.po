"            Regardless of which Intrepid you choose, it will be built upon a design that reflects each owner's unique and discerning vision. But what is common to each one will be a meticulous attention to detail, highly innovative and thoughtful features from bow to stern and the most advanced and highest quality materials and processes implemented at every stage of construction. At Intrepid, we don't build boats the way they could be. We build boats the way they should be."
