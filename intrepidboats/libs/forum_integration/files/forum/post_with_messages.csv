35,"As we have told everyone......we will release all new info here in the owners forum before we do anywhere else. We feel that (as owners of Intrepids) you deserve to get what Mark and I call ""The inside iggy"" on any new and upcoming projects. So here is the first one....and it is a big one.

Here are the details to the new 327 Cuddy that we hope to have ready to debut in Fort Lauderdale at the boat show at the end of October.

First, the boat of course runs on the 327 Center console hull platform with the dual vented aft keel, the increased freeboard, wider chines, and an overall increased running surface designed to accommodate the heavier outboard engines out there. The reaction to the 327 Center console has been great. We have customers with this new hull that had the previous version and they are blown away by the changes to the new hull. 

Next.....let's talk about the cuddy cabin. The old 32 had the rotating head under the step which everybody thought was pretty cool. It was a way to get the head out of sight and make the best use of the room in the cuddy. Well, the head was still in the cuddy and every once in a while we would hear comments like ""we love our 32 cuddy ...but...if someone is passed out down in the cuddy and someone else needs to use the head, you have to wake them up and kick them out to use it"". Or ....just the smell of having it in the cabin without it being partitioned off in any way. But now.....with the new hull, we gained some cockpit space....enough to move the head out of the cuddy and we created a separate head inside the console like what we have on the Center console. Now they are completely separate from each other.

The other comment we heard from customers was that...""we don't use the cuddy that much, it is more of a big closet than anything and a place to get out of the weather if it gets nasty out""......so.....we decided that if some people use it like a big closet, let's organize their closet. 

So for starters we are building integrated overhead storage units on both the port and starboard sides of the forward cabin where the valances used to be on the old model. This was really just dead space and now it will give people a place to put their ""stuff"". Almost like the overhead storage in an airplane.

The other thing we are doing is building in a folding v-berth filler for the settee inside. Before if you got this option you had to store these pieces someplace (usually on the seating) and it limited the cuddy even more. Well now they are built in and they come standard.

Also, now that the head is not in the cuddy anymore the sink does not have to be there because we are moving it out into the head that is in the console. This allows us to turn this area into another place to put your ""stuff"" or we can put a small refrigerator in there which was never an option before.....and if you remember the old 32, the space above that was another dead space and we plan on turning that into a storage center as well. We organized your closet.

Out in the cockpit we already talked about the head being in the console but the other changes to the console are the angle changes to the backrests to make them more comfortable and we are extending the backrests to wrap around onto the forward cabin bulkhead on both the console seating and the starboard side seat so that they match. Now if you want to lie down facing aft... you can to that too.

We are also adding the aft facing seat like we did on the 400 Cuddy. That was a big hit with our customers and we had the room to do it with the new hull so we put it there and we were able to do it without losing the console cooler that everyone loves so much. ....and we are going to hinge that hatch sideways so that you can access the console cooler from the front forward seating or from behind the console. 

The boat also has an entirely new deck that has the new sheer line that matches the all the new hull design. Much sexier than the old model. 

These are a lot of the major points of the new boat....and as you read above....most of these ideas come directly from our customers (even though we would like to take all the credit) and we are lucky to be able to get all of that input from our customers because they have a relationship directly with us. It is not like a boat that is bought off of a dealer's lot where the manufacturer never knows who his end user is unless he gets a warranty registration card in the mail. We build our boats directly for our customers which allows us to get feedback directly from them on everything they like....and everything that they don't like, and having those type of close relationships with our customers is what helps us build better boats day in and day out.

So there you have it.....you guys know first. In a few days I will release these facts on Facebook and to the press.....but as we promised you have it first.....and we will continue to do it this way with new releases. We owe it to all of you who continue to be loyal to us and our brand and we can't thank you enough for that continued loyalty.

You have our promise....we will continue to innovate new products based on your feedback. We are here to serve........and the entire Intrepid Team thanks you for taking the time to read this.

Take care,

Ken

36,"The new layout will be a big hit.  A lot of the changes that Ken described I tried to incorporate into my 2009 323 Cuddy.  We weren't able to move the head to the console on the old hull, but we did eliminate the sink and added an extra hanging locker in its place.

50,"was wondering the inpact on e-85 fuel on my current fuel lines from the main tank.my intrepid is a 1999 and schould i be looking at replacing them,and if so which brand and how difficult to do![:|] ",===MARK===
51,"Hey Skippy.....
I would change out the engine feed lines for sure by now and it is pretty easy to do from the tank to the fuel filetrs and a littler harder when you get to the engine rig tube, but still not that bad. You should have an access cover over the top of the fuel tank over the pick up tubes. There will be two hose clamps on each hose barb that you will have to remove and then you can pull the hoses off. The hoses should run throug a PVC chase down the center of the boat into the aft bilge where the fuel filters are and the bilge pumps. Before you pull the old hoses out, I would lnk the new hose to the old hoses and lube them up so while you are pulling out the old ones, you are pulling in the new ones. 
If you have an aux fuel tank too it will be the same type of set up and they pull through the same chase tube so if you are doing all of them make sure that you also label them when you do this so that you do not get aux and main fuel tank lines crossed at the filter.

Then you have to go from the filter through the engine rig tube and I suggest doing it the same way.

I hop this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.

63,"Been thinking about getting a new truck. I'd like something that I can tow my 339 W/A a couple of times a year, and probably not for more than a couple hundred miles at most. More for winter storage and just in case of hurricane rather than on a regular basis. It'll also be a daily driver, so I'm also interested in decent mpg and so I'm looking at the Ford F150s w/ the EcoBoost engine. I can get the truck configured w/ a tow rating of 11,300#.

Powerboat Guide lists the 339 W/A at 5,500#. I'm guessing that's bare, no top and no engines, so I'm thinking closer to 7k# dry, around 9k# w/ gear if the tanks were full, plus around 1,250 for an aluminum trailer. Total of 10,250# worse-case scenario, and within the tow rating for the truck, [i]IF[/i] the base weight is correct. Question is is the 5,500# accurate? Seems kind of light for a 33'+ W/A?

Anyone ever weigh thier 339?",===MARK===
64,"I would figure that the boat with fuel and gear would weigh in at somewhere between 10K & 11K pounds.  You'll have to add the weight of your trailer to that.  All of our boats are different so the most effective way to get a weight value would be to run it over a scale.  Call me if you want to discuss.  Regards,

Joe Brenna 727-548-1260 ext. 229.",===MARK===
65,"Thanks for the quick reply, Joe. I think you gave me a similar estimate a while ago via email. That would put me pretty close or even slightly over the limit of the truck I'm looking at, but I'd hate to go to a SuperDuty if I don't have to.

Problem is that I don't currently have A) a trailer for it; B) a truck that could tow it if I did (I [i]might[/i] be able to borrow one, but not knowing for sure the spec'd weight makes me nervous to do so); and C) a lot of commercial scales in the area (that I know of....). I understand the boats are all different, with different equipment, but they're probably pretty close, and I would think the biggest weight variable would be the 300 gallons of fuel at ~7lbs / gal. I was hoping that another owner may have weighed one at some point and be able to give me a better estimate, which would also help to determine what size trailer I would need (I was thinking ~12k# tri-axle).

Where does Powerboat Guide get its weight ratings (and other specs) from?

",===MARK===
67,"Hi Skippy,

Factory installed auxiliary fuel tanks are really the only safe way to carry additional fuel, so installation at this point would be difficult and costly.  I wouldn't put any kind of tankage in the cabin because of the fact that fumes might be able to accumulate.  I've heard of some people using bladder bags that sit on deck and can be burned off first, then folded up and stowed on the way home.  I can only recommend a properly installed system that follows Coast Guard and ABYC standards.  Call me to discuss if you like.

I've heard good things about overnighting in Clewiston, but will have to save that for when I'm headed back across the state to Bimini someday  (tortugas is my next adventure)

I feel (and maybe I'm biased) that these boats are perfectly designed for these trips.  Have a blast and throw up some pics when you're back.

87,Thanks Phertel for the reply and information.  Will post some photos and plan to have a good time in all the places we stop at.  Let me know when your coming down this way for the Tortugas trip.  We went a couple of years ago and had a great time even though the weather turned  and the genny quit (summer).  It's how you overcome adversity that is memorable!

89,"phertel, 
I just took a look for your hull file, and unfortunately it seems that it was one of the files we have lost when we moved over to our new facility a number of years ago.  If you are looking to have your boat re-wired I would recommend you speak to Jeff Delsontro at Exact Marine over in Dania Beach.  Jeff used to be Intrepid’s Service Manager and now works exclusively on Intrepid’s.  His phone number is 954-213-2742

91,"My wife and I just picked up a super sweet 2002 289WA.  The boat was amazingly well cared for by the original owner, has low hours (280) on the engines and so far we love everything about it.  We found a nice spotlight in the cabin that plugs into a standard 12V socket like that found in cars, but much to my surprise there is not a socket anywhere in the helm.  The only socket on the boat is in the cabin where the igloo electric cooler/heater plugs in.  Am I not looking hard enough, or is normal for these boats not to have a 12V socket somewhere in the helm as a standard build item?  It's not a big deal, as we can easily have one added...I just thought I would throw the question out there in case I am not looking hard enough! 
Thanks!
John ",===MARK===
92,"John, 
Congratulations on the purchase of your Intrepid, and welcome to the Family!  As you know our boats are all built to each customer’s specifications so some boats may have options that others do not.  The 12v plug is not a standard feature on the helm, but is something that can be very easily added.  If you decided you would like to add one you can either run it to an open accessory switch on your switch panel, or right to an open circuit on your terminal strip inside the console.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at the factory!

If you run that tank dry you can get air in the fuel system, so it's best to manage your fuel and not let either tank run dry.  Call me at the office if you want to discuss.  Regards, Joe Brenna V.P.

107,"Well we finally did it!  We departed on the 10th with 30knot winds out of the NE.  The temps were cold for us but we tuffed it out, staying close to the shallows and then into the Gulf heading up the Keys towards the ICW and into Biscayne Bay.  It was not too bad, just cold and windy, not a drop of spray.  Once into Biscayne Bay the chop was bearable all the way thru to the Port of Miami.  From there it was slow go with bridge openings and the no wake, idle zones, minimum wake less than 15"", manatee zones, etc up to Lighthouse Point 9 plus hours.    The ICW was filled with beautiful homes complete with every kind/size of yacht you could think of.  We stayed at Lighthouse Point Marina for the night for some cold beverages, good food, good time and good night's rest.  The marina was very clean, great restaurant/bar with live band, and people there very friendly.  After breakfast we departed for Lake Park to visit friends, just a short ride of maybe 40 miles up the ICW which was about 3 hours.  More beautiful homes/yachts, oh and several more bridges to open.  Lake Park was also very clean, friendly people, and a Duncan Donuts and Winn Dixie within walking distance.  The next day we proceeded up the ICW to Stuart, more of the beautiful scenery, arriving at Sunset Bay Resort and Marina a few hours later.  This marina I highly recommend, it is very clean, friendly people, and a short walk to downtown Stuart with great shops and restaurants.  We departed after breakfast down the St. Lucie Waterway and into the first lock.  We were raised about 12 feet.  It was a mixed experience, negative side I would have told the lock master that I would wait for the barge and tug to go thru first before I would enter the lock.  Smelling diesel exhaust for 30 minutes was not fun, nor was watching the two guys trying to keep the barge from being pushed back towards my boat a fun time.  We survived a little smarter for the next several locks.  When we reached Port Mayacca Lock, it was open so all we had to do was idle thru the lock and into Lake Okeechobee.  Once into the Lake we soon reached Clewiston and stayed at Roland Martin's Marina, the trip took about 4 hours.  We had a good time at the restaurant/tiki bar.  The down side was a little buggy with the mosquitoes.  We were hoping the winter would have slowed the bugs, but do to the heavy rains the week prior allowed the new hatch.  The marina is definitely a time warp to old Florida and a memorable experience.  We departed in the morning thru the rim canal to Moorhaven lock, where we were lifted down about 6 feet.  On thru the river to the Ortona Lock, down a few more feet, and a few more bridge openings, on to the Franklin Lock which was only two more feet down.  We soon came to Fort Myers and back to the Manatee Zones of no wake, slow speed.  We tied up at Tarpon Point Marina in Cape Coral after 5 hours.  The marina was very clean, complete with a tiki bar, grill, and shops.  We left in the morning for Marco Island, staying at Marco Island Marina, less than two hours.  This marina was also very clean, friendly people, with a pool and restaurant.  We decided due to the bug problem in Clewiston along with the pressing cold front to skip the Little Shark River stay and run across the Gulf for home, stopping at a few spots to throw some hooks.  The Verado's ran like kittens, purring along and ever ready to run.  We had a great time, only wished we could have stayed longer in a few of the places.  We are glad to have made the run up the ICW, we always wanted to see it.  Now that we have seen the ICW, I think it will be a long time before I want to see it again!  Now for the next cruise, thinking up some ideas.",===MARK===

118,"I am starting to get into the boat, had a few things come up I am curious about. First would be is there a build diagram laying around somewhere that would show wiring routes, plumbing etc.?

Second, I am concerned the tank may need to be replaced. There looks to have been a repair done already, and I have some minor fuel smell. I have not opened up the main compartment yet. How good is the access to the tank once I pull that main cover? Is it heavily foamed in? Are there specs available on the original design that I can give to a builder to have a new tank made?

Third issue. I found water in the foam under the port side bunk. I can't tell hyet whether that is a small leak from somewhere or if the foam is waterlogged. Is there a way for water to drain to bilge from that area? Anyone ever seen one with water issues in the foam in that area?

Fourth, under the forward hatch in the cabin, there is a small bulkhead. It did not have a drain and has about five gallons of standing water, my guess is from the anchor locker. Should I shop vac that out and check periodically, or can I just make a small drain hole in it? I noticed the cabin also does not have a floor drain, so I am not sure if water from that area can get back to the bilge or if the area under the cabin sole is 100% foam filled and cut off from the bilge.

Last thing... Do any of the old molds still exist for this boat? I understand that once upon a time fiberglass dive platform additions were available that fit on either side of the integrated bracket.

Thanks for help on any/all of these. [:)] ",===MARK===

Please send the hull umber of your boat so I can access whatever information might be available as answers to your inquiry.  The first thing that needs to be addressed is the minor fuel smell that you mention, we need to make sure that a potential hazard doesn't exist.  I should be able to identify the tank that was installed as original once I know which boat you have.  It will be much easier for me to use my Intrepid Powerboats email address to answer you, so please contact me at jbrenna@intrepidpowerboats.com with your email address.

125,"Bwight, 
We have yet to do a retrofit on one of our Folding Fiberglass rear bench seats on any of the models, we have only done new installations.  I believe the cost to add one onto a boat is $3500-4000 and a retrofit would be more as there needs to be some changes made to the boat to allow the seat to fit correctly.  That being said, if you were looking for a regular rear bench seat, I would call Richie Wells at Gator Upholstery (954) 410-6544.  He has done a number of them for our customers and the cost would be significantly less than the Fiberglass seat.

I'm posting the reply I sent by email yesterday in an effort to help other forum members.

Joe

==============================================================================

Hi Tim,

I spent some time going through our archives this morning and wasn’t able to find your original hull file.  I found the ones just before and just after yours so the number you gave me is a good one.  We have had a  lot of people work for us since 1989 and some of them weren’t as careful with putting things back where they found them as others.  I have attached some original sales brochures that will give you specifications for your boat.  We have always built custom boats so specs may vary from boat to boat.

As far as construction drawings that show wire runs and plumbing are concerned, I’m afraid to say that we can’t supply you with anything in that realm.  We were a young company in the late eighties that was concerned with building quality boats, documenting what we had done wasn’t as important then as it is now.  If you’ve restored other boats then you probably have a strong knowledge of what might be the best way to figure things out as you move through the restoration process.  Sending pictures to us with your particular questions helps solve problems as well.

Have you pressure tested the fuel system?  That’s the best way to see if the tank has a leak.  We put 2 or 3 pounds of air pressure into our new tanks and let them sit for 24 hours to see if there is any loss of pressure.  I’m not sure how much you can visually inspect but if the top of the tank doesn’t have any corrosion then you are probably in pretty good shape.  I believe that the tank was put in place and then two part foam was poured into the areas surrounding it, thus encapsulating the tank.  After that there is a fiberglass bond that ties the top of the tank to the bulkheads and stringers.  Removing the tank is not an easy task, but it did get put in, so it will come out.  I’m wondering if the odor you mentioned in your inquiry is due to residual gasoline that might have permeated the foam that surrounds the tank.  Cutting the bulkhead that’s just aft of the tank may be necessary to allow it to slide back for removal.  I’ll ask you to see if there’s a plate on the tank that identifies the manufacturer, we will be able to direct you to someone who can make a new tank for you if that becomes necessary.

The areas that have been filled with foam weren’t meant to have water in them, any number of things could have happened over the years to make that area wet.  I agree with your thoughts on getting the water out using a shop vac and then installing drains to let any water that might eventually find its way into those voids drain itself.  I would say that the bilges under the cabin sole could be foam filled if there are no hatches in the sole.  

We have approximately 4,000 molds for the current models of boats that we build now.  This is what enables us to provide all of the custom features that we have always offered.  It is a monumental task to catalog and keep track of all these molds.  We usually keep small molds for a few years after we stop production of a particular model, but we don’t have anything on hand for boats built in the eighties or nineties.  I’m not sure where you have the boat, but there are people who can build parts or molds for various parts.  Let me know what you need and I’ll see what we might be able to do.

I hope I’ve answered your questions thoroughly.  Please contact me again with any others you may have.

Best regards,

Joe

I would love four strokes but I am concerned about the additional weight a pair of 4 strokes would add.
I also am curious if there's any experience with changes in performance with a modern pair 225 or 200 2 strokes and what performance numbers might be.

I am much more concerned about efficency in teh 25-35 knt range than top speed.

Thank you for your input and help.

165,"Hi Everyone,

I have a 2001 377 WA and love that boat!  Anyway, it appears that my A/C condensation pan is filling up and over flowing.  I ran a snake up the drain hose from the shower sump box, but it still seems clogged and not draining properly.  From looking at the A/C unit, it looks like there's a 90 pvc connection coming out of the drip pan and connecting to the hose that runs to the shower sump box.  There doesn't seem to be a way to get to it without taking the whole A/C unit out.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to clear the clog?  It seems like such an easy thing to tackle, but has driven me crazy for the last few days.

Thanks!",===MARK===
166,Same experience here.  I love Intrepid!,===MARK===
167,"Ok  - problem solved.  I had some work done on the boat over the winter which included the installation of a new shower sump box, float, and pump.  The whole box was replaced as well.  Anyway, when the new box was installed, the hoses were swapped.  Meaning, the A/C drain hose was connected to the discharge side of the shower sump pump, and the overboard discharge hose was connected to a regular drain barb on the new box.  So, the condensation from the A/C was flowing normally down the drain hose, but had no where to go once it hit that one way pump.  It ended up filling up the drain hose and eventually backing up enough to fill the condensation pan.  The whole time I was snaking the overboard discharge hose.  Anyway, once I disconnected the A/C drain hose from the wrong barb on the sump box, water flowed out until the drain pan was empty.....",===MARK===

When the 289 was first designed she was built around the two stroke power plants, that being said we have had a few customer re-power with the new 225 and 250 four stroke outboards and have been very happy with the performance with the boat especially the mid range fuel economy.  If you are looking to do a re-power I would highly recommend that you give Jeff at Exact Marine a call.  He has done more than his fair share of 289’s and would be able to give you performance info on any motors you are looking at.  His phone number is (954) 213-2742

176,"Hi.

For the past year, I have been the happy owner of a 1991 246 WA powered by a 1996 Yamaha 250 Saltwater Series (pre-OX66).  The engine has a relatively new powerhead and lower unit, so I'm planning to keep it for a bit but would like to make sure it's set up correctly to give the best possible performance, especially since it was not the factory engine (I'm guessing it came with a Merc but don't really know).  I have a number of questions but am starting with the engine height.

The engine has 1 hole below the bolt (I believe this means it can go up one hole) and a prior owner installed a wedge.  She porpoises at speeds under 40 mph unless the engine is trimmed all the way down, and porpoises more with a couple folks sitting on the aft bench.  At WOT I see around 45mph (I've seen up to 48 when it's just me and she's totally empty) and can tilt the engine as high as the two rams will get it without ventilating (so long as I'm running straight.  this can't be efficient as I'm throwing a 4 foot rooster tail but she doesn't lose any speed when it's tilted that way).  In addition, when trimmed normally I can't see the anti-ventilation plate.  I assume that all of this means the engine's too low - Does anyone with experience on these particular boats know if this sounds to be the case?  Does anyone know which hole the Yamaha should be in, and is it possible that it has to come up farther than the one available hole?  If it has to come up farther, would a manual jackplate with a 6"" setback (the least i can find) work?

Any other suggestions or information would be great.  Thanks.

The 400 has a great rough water ride and would be the perfect canyon day boat.  I had the pleasure of fishing our 400 Open TE up in Mississippi on November of last year for Kingfish and we made 90+ mile runs out each day and never felt uncomfortable when it got rough out.

198,"Interesting piece of data on my boat.  Just had a trailer built by Loadmaster out of Tampa.  we used the published weight data on the boat when designing.  Per the spec sheet the boat weighs 3400 dry.  Two Yamaha 200 HPDI 2 strokes for power.  The boat seemed quite a bit heavier than expected the first time I pulled it.  Had it weighed at an officlal scale and the weight was 9220!  The trailer weighs 1200#, the motors weigh 1000#, fuel was maybe 40 gallons so 240#  That means my boat is actually coming in at approx 6700#, or 3300# greater than the spec sheet dry weight of 3400#!  Any ideas on how we explain this delta in weight?  ",===MARK===

As an aside, someone called me this month asking for the weight of a 289 Walkaround and I estimated that a wet version of that boat was somewhere around 8,500 #.  To my knowledge we never published weights for the boats we've built.  Regards,  Joe Brenna - V.P. Customer Service - Intrepid Powerboats ",===MARK===

Hi Joe - thanks for the quick reply!  It is impressive how closely you guys monitor the discussions on here!  

below is a URL that should take you to the data I found on the boat.  I did go through all of the Intrepid source documentation I have on the boat and you are correct that the weigth is not declared.  When I was meeting with Fred at Loadmaster in Tampa, he had a hard copy of the ""big book"" which I think was the powerboatguide and it also identified the dry weight of the boat at 3400#.  Ultimately, Loadmaster had to build an entirely new trailer for me once we understood the actual weight so it would be good to update industry info if possible.

[url=http://www.abercrombiesaleoutletuk.co.uk/]Abercrombie and Fitch[/url] (A&F), the brand that is well loved for its American-style, cool, casual and trendy, is now aggressively expanding into Asia. Before its grand opening in Singapore, 40 muscular half-naked men stood outside the still unopened store. The alluring smiles and eyes, free hugs, and photo shoot caused a stirring riot. In addition, A&F launched a giant four-floor advertisement at a traffic-heavy shopping area. A muscular topless man wearing extremely low-slung jeans in the giant billboard caught everyone’s attention in Singapore.

[url=http://www.abercrombiesaleoutletuk.co.uk/]Abercrombie and Fitch Outlet[/url] cleverly built up its brand image and conveyed information through the controversy in Singapore. However, except for the opening campaigns, in order to enhance its brand loyalty, I suggest A&F do more events to focus on Asian customers. For example, use more Asian models on catalogues to show customers that American style outfits also fit and look good on Asian people. Meanwhile, A&F should do more events to collaborate with celebrities or magazines to lead the new fashion trends in Asia. Last but not least, I suggest A&F conduct more market research to understand Asian purchase behavior and fashion points. With these suggestions, A&F can adjust their products to fit the Asian consumers’ needs.

307,"Hi Mark, The Delta 22 # anchor and the Fortress FX-16 were the most popular anchors on the 366 Bushwackers that we built.  I looked at a picture of your original anchor and it's a Fortress.  My best advice is to get a Delta and see how it rests in the roller assembly if you decide to make a change.  The same goes for a plow.  I do believe that the Delta will seat properly but can't swear to it.  The spec for the rode is 9/16"" rope and 5/16"" H.T. chain.  If G4 is a different nomenclature for H.T. then you'll be fine.  Rope Incorpoated in Fort Lauderdale is a good source for a rode, Jack there is very helpful and can be reached at (954) 525-6575.  I'll copy this message to your email address along with a picture of the original anchor installation.  Longer rodes require more attention when they are being loaded into the anchor locker, so going forward to watch how the rode is laying into the locker is a good idea when you use something longer than standard.  I always like to be forward when the anchor is being retrieved so I can see if there's anything out of the ordinary coming up with the anchor.  Joe",===MARK===

310,"One of the benefits of building boats directly for our customers is being able to have a relationship with the end user and with that in mind, the inspiration for the new 375 Walk Around comes directly from customer input.

Customers love the accessibility of a Walk Around but they do not like the conventional look. That usually is what causes some people to buy a cuddy instead. Because it is “Sexier”….. low profile….and they are willing to sacrifice the easier accessibility for the look…..and that is where the new 375 Walk Around comes in.

With listening to some of our customers saying that they had to have the 350 Walk Around because of the easy bow accessibility or saying that they had to have the 370 Cuddy because of the sexier profile we decided to morph the concepts. The 375 Walk Around has the sexy lines of the Cuddy and has the Walk Around accessibility.

The other comments were that they loved the forward seating in front of the helm station because you could interact with everyone while at the helm but the people in that seating wish they had better visibility. So, on the new 375 we raised the cockpit from the helm station forward in order to cure that and it also gives that same improved visibility to the helmsman as well which is a benefit because of the slightly raised shear from the new style shear line. This change in the shear line also now gives us over 6 foot headroom in the cabin too which is a huge improvement as well.

In the past, when wanting a generator you had to sacrifice the below deck bait well. Not anymore. You can have both. 

When it came to cabin we decided to make a bold move and follow the success we had on our last new cabin model the 327 cuddy and move the head out of the cabin and put it into the console. It took a head that you could not stand in before that also took up a large part of the cabin and is now a full stand up head with a separate stall shower added as well. The head is twice the size as the old one. This also opened up the cabin to allow us to give more seating below and a much nicer galley.  

We also added the overhead storage compartments down both the port and starboard sides of the cabin like the 327 Cuddy. These were all things that we did on the 327 that all of the new owners loved so we implemented these changes into the new 375 Walk Around.

Now throw in some new hull side windows to this model as well along with the newly designed dive door introduced on the sister 375 Center Console model and it gives you a pretty good overview of the new 375 Walk Around.  

Please be sure to see it at its debut in the Miami International boat show this February 14th-18th.

328,"Hi all,

After years of gawking at Intrepids (and working on a customer's in high school and college), I am finally the owner of a 1991 Intrepid 246. I bought it off of one of the partners at my law firm.  It currently has an old Yamaha 225 OX66, but I am yanking it to put on my Yamaha 200 HPDI.

Any experience regarding performance of this hull with a 200? Hoping it won't be too much of a drop off.

Joe Brenna - I have heard nothing but awesome experiences with you and the team at Intrepid. I know my boat is over 20 years old, but I am already sold for life. While I can't wait for the day I'll be able to join the waiting list for a 'factory fresh' Intrepid, I will spend the years until then enjoying the 246, as I know it will be up for it. I will be calling you soon to learn about what information you may have on my hull. 

Thanks for everything,

333,"Proper management of [url=http://www.timberlandschoenenonline.eu/]Timberland[/url] is essential to accomplish good returns from your investment and to meet your specific goals. Forest and timberland habitats reflect many natural forces which impact them. These forces are wind, ice, fire, floods, insects and disease. Many wildlife species depend on these natural disturbances to create habitat for their survival. Forest openings from these disturbances increase the availability of sunlight to the forest floor, which generates a dramatic increase of understory plants. This provides abundant cover and food for many species. This is true of most timberland nationwide, but nowhere is it more true than in South Arkansas and North Louisiana.

From a wildlife perspective, a forest can be divided into the following layers - canopy, mid-story and understory. Some forest dwelling species use all layers while others access only one or two. Although tree canopies serve as food and nesting sites for a variety of wildlife, many forest [url=http://www.timberlandschoenenonline.eu/]Timberland Outlet[/url] depend on food and cover at ground level. Without disturbances, the tree canopy shades out wildlife sustaining plants and impedes growth of seedlings on the forest floor. When deer management on hunting properties is the objective, it is important to encourage the growth of browse that is within easy reach. The top spot makes the marked trees easy to locate, and the butt spot leaves paint on the stump for verification that only the marked trees were harvested.

Periodic disturbances can be imitated through harvests as part of [url=http://www.timberlandschoenenonline.eu/]Timberland Schoenen[/url] management. Thinning is a valuable forest management practice and can be conducted with wildlife in mind, or for recreational land purposes. The decision to remove a tree should be based on harvesting the lower quality and less desirable tree species. Taking the best trees decreases the overall quality of the forest for wildlife and timber production. Remove tree and shrub species that have less wildlife and economic value in order to reduce competition around the valuable crop trees. Removing the competition increases growth rates of the valuable trees and allows their crowns to expand. For timberland that has been purchased as an investment property, this means harvesting the least valuable species first to allow the most economically viable species to grow toward the next selective harvest. 

In your wildlife management plan consider how the forest will renew itself. As the forest canopy and mid-story are opened, plan for regenerating desirable tree species that do not grow in shaded conditions. Older trees will eventually die or be harvested and replaced by young seedlings. Build tree regeneration into your plan in order to increase the value of the timberland. If yours is a [url=http://www.timberlandschoenenonline.eu/]Timberland Nederland[/url] investment property in Arkansas or Louisiana, this natural tree regeneration should be Loblolly Pines or one of the more valuable species of Oak. Increased sunlight to the understory will encourage seedlings from desirable overstory trees and increase browse and cover for wildlife underneath.",===MARK===

339,"Hi Joe,

just over 6 months ago I replaced the original Bennett tab control switch with the new EIC kit.  I now find the connections on the relay module have corroded and this and the blue wire will have to be replaced.  My installer mounted the module in the bilge area (of my 30 ft. open) as the wires from the pump to the module limited where it is placed.  I am wondering where does Intrepid place the relay module on new installations and if longer wiring is needed for the placement if not in the bilge area?  I am concerned about putting a new module in the same location and having to replace it in another couple of months!!!  Your advise will be appreciated.

347,Im having an issue with my 366 cuddy's dive door in that the bolt at the apex of the hinge that attaches the rope pole to the ladder keeps on bending and sometimes breaking whenever we use the ladder. When I purchased the boat used the rope pole was un-attached so I bolted it together with a heavy stainles steel bolt snadwiching it in the middle with a thin nylon washer on either side. What I see is that whenever you add weight to the ladder the rope support pole wants to  bend the attachment bolt. Tension from the weight loaded pole (130-180 lb max. passenger) is pulling the pole twards the bow of the boat. I have changed out the bolt and nylon spacer washers many times only to have this happen again after only 3 or 4 climbs into the boat. I have looked at a few other dive doors at the Harbour Towne location to check out the method of attachment for the rope pole and they all look assembled the same way I have done it. 

Any suggestions?

My wife and I departed the lower Keys on Tuesday May 20 across the Gulf to Naples  (3.5 hours) where we stayed at the Naples City Docks.  As usual the weather man was not having a stellar day as conditions were different from what he had reported it to be, imagine that!  While in Naples we enjoyed checking out the many shops and pubs.  The next morning we departed and cruised up to Sanibel and into the ICW where we stopped for lunch at Cabbage Key.  If you are ever in the area you must stop here for lunch.  The restaurant has over $70K in dollar bills lining the walls and ceiling.  One thing to be careful about is the Otters, we were told by the dockmaster that if they can get into your boat they will rummage thru all your coolers for food or bait, including livewells!  We were lucky however a lot of other boaters were not.  After lunch and walking around the historic Key, we departed and soon arrived at Little Gasparilla and met up with our family.  We spent the next several days boating and enjoying the island and the many sandbars in the area.  We left on Monday and headed for our island home in the Keys, knowing if we did not leave then that we would be staying in the area till Friday or Saturday due to the declining weather.  We spent the next several hours dodging the many thunder storms along the coast and across the Gulf, thanks to the on board satellite weather display.  The seas were definitely not the best but we pushed thru the roughness and made it home.  We cannot say enough good things about how well designed, built, and safe these boats really are.

I am interested in adding a relatively simple tower without controls, shade, etc.  Access would have to be cut through the sunbrella with a zipper.  More or less, a basic tower.  We also have the upgraded console on it, not the standard, so plenty of room to stand on the console and get up to the tower. In the struts where the tower would be located, there appears to be sufficient support for a tower (the struts are wider, and almost seem like they were intended for a possible tower) and the weight intended for the tower would be limited to no more than 180 pounds. Boat is currently in the upper keys undergoing some maintenance items. So, my question is for recommendations for who might install the tower, and what type it should be (i.e., what manufacturer/fabricator).

I also want to install a windlass and place two cleats to the side of it, so any recommendations for an appropriate windlass would be appreciated as well.

428,"The bow thruster on our 2005 348 Open was acting up last fall as well.   It sometimes slowed to a VERY low RPM and sometimes would not spin at all.

The problem turned out to be jammed brushes on the thruster motor.   A shop specializing in electric motors fixed the problem in a few minutes.   They said the brushes swelled, causing the problem.  Root cause was operating the thruster at low RPM due to weakened batteries - I didn't recall running the thruster with poorly charged batteries, though.

I have shut the drain sea cock and have closed the feed seacock to the bat well system. Even with both closed, it still manages to fill to the water line. Does anyone know what I am doing wrong or anything else I can try? 
Thanks
Gary Buhler ",===MARK===
430,"Gary, I have the same boat (mine is an Open) and use the aft livewell on most trips.  But, I keep my boat on a lift so the livewell gravity drains when the boat's not in use.

I have shut off the seacocks, though, and believe that stopped the well from filling.  I'll have to try that when I next go out and will let you know how well it kept dry.

The plumbing for the livewell differs based on the configuration of fishboxes and livewells on your boat.  Mine has forward and aft livewells *and* a port fishbox.  In my case, the livewells are connected to one macerator and the fishbox is connected to another.  Valving to isolate one of the wells/boxes would be quite different if you have a different configuration.

You might find an answer in the Owner's Manual -- Intrepid has them on line here:  http://www.intrepidboats.com/owners-portal/owner-manuals.aspx

Here's a typical set of instructions from Intrepid for draining the livewell -- but it sounds like you may already have tried that:

[quote]
The level of water in the baitwell is maintained by the height of the drain tube, which fits within the drain fitting.

NOTE
The baitwell will fill beyond capacity if the baitwell pump is ON and the baitwell drain seacock valve is OFF.

To drain the baitwell the drain tube must be removed from the drain fitting in the baitwell and the baitwell drain seacock valve must be opened.

NOTE
The baitwell will not drain completely when not underway. The baitwell drain and the drain thruhull are both below the waterline of the boat. The baitwell will only drain to the level of the waterline of the boat. To completely drain the Baitwell the drain seacock must be opened while the boat is underway (on plane) or when the boat is out of the water. After draining the baitwell close the baitwell drain seacock while underway. [/quote]",===MARK===
431,It will only drain if you open the drain seacock and then run the boat......i find i have to get up above 8 or 10 knots to get it to drain.  Then shut the seacock while underway and you'll be fine!!  Its below the waterline so unless you get that bow up and have some forward motion nothing will work.,===MARK===

I am assuming this is a plexi-glass windshield if it is getting dull.... There is a product called Novis. They have a couple of different products that can help. You will need to apply the fine scratch remover (red label) first to get rid of small scratches and the fogginess; then the plastic clean and shine (blue label) for a final cleaning and polish to help keep away that fogginess. Here is some more information on the product

Since it's proved impossible to find any reviews of that year model I was wondering what the differences are between a 1990 245 and a new 245.  

And when I say differences I mean differences in the hull and performance.  I know that the newer ones have a lot of amenities and comforts that the 1990s didn't.  Are there differences, modifications, improvements, etc... in the hulls between the new ones and a 1990 model? Weight?  Fuel tanks? 

Any concerns with that year model?

I have a 1991 23 Open which I think is the same boat that your are talking about.  It is very well made but i think it is very different from the modern 245 as it weighs only 2200 lbs bare hull weight.  The new ones are much heavier.  I can compare it to a Scout 23SF that I rented for a week last year.  The Intrepid rides much better in the steep chop around Vineyard Sound than the scout did.  There is no foward seating in mine and there is on the newer ones.  Mine does not need any tab and if anything rides better with more weight in the stern.  It feels much bigger than the Scout did in terms of room.  The Scout had good storage in the console where there was room for a potty as well as skis, wakeboard etc.  No such storage in my intrepid.

Hello and thank you for using our forum; I look forward to assisting you thru your projects.

1. The macerator that we use for our fish boxes does get installed inline with the drain hose below the waterline using a PVC Tee; however there is an additional discharge hose that will need to be added above the waterline. This gives you the ability to drain water manually when the boats is lifted out of the water by opening the seacock' or by activating the macerator switch and discharging it overboard with the seacock closed.

2. The second bilge pump would be installed in front of the currently installed pump at the same placement (this allows the pump to discharge as much water as possible).  The float switch for the second bilge pump should be placed a few inches higher that the original float switch; this will make sure that both pumps are not competing with on another (when the bilge pump turns off there is so water that will flow backwards thru the hose, if the float switches are at the same height the possibility of the pumps cycling is high). You will need to add an additional thru hull for the second pump. 

3. If an optional water was installed during the build process it would have been placed under the deck. At this point to add a freshwater system you would have to measure one of the deck hatches in a storage locker and install a tank or bladder bag there. As for the pump I would recommend the Shurflo Aqua King II (5 GPM).

4. Unfortunately we did put wiring diagrams in the hull file as we do now. However if the console switch panel has a switch for the freshwater or macerator there would have been a wire run into the bilge and ""dog boned"" for future use. Look around in the bilges on the bulkheads and on the underside of the deck to see if you see a bundle of wires secured (they should be labeled with the specific function of the wire).

I am going to send you a reply via your email with some pictures of an installed macerator and dual bilge pump installation.

451,[quote=gtsr100rs;449]Hi  I just purchased a '91 23 Open and the macerator was missing from the forward fish box plumbing.  The boatyard I used ran the hose from the foward fish box drain to the macerator/pump and the outlet of the macerator pump to the portside above waterline drain.  I do not have a switch position for the macerator and they disconnected my lights to power the pump (nice huh?).  I am trying to figure out how to fix that.  

My live/baitwell drain goes to a below waterline thru-hull seacock.  I only have one bilge pump so can't help you there.[/quote]


Very odd they would have disconnected one item to hook up another. If there isn't an addition open switch such as an accessory switch; we have an additional sub panel switch that you can purchase with a switch and breaker labeled macerator. This would solve the issue of either having lights or a macerator. You can contact Walt Putman with Intrepid Customer Care for pricing:

I meant to also ask about engine mounting. My 1996 originally came with twin 150 Mercury EFIs with 21P Laser props. She now has twin Optimaxs with 19P Tempest Plus props. The original EFI engines pulled 5,500 RPMs and ran 56 MPH when Intrepid originally sea trailed the boat. 
The Optimaxs (they have less than 80 hours on them) will only achieve 5,000 RPM and about 48 MPH. In addition, the boat porpoises unless the trim tabs are all the way down. Even trimming tabs up a touch results in porpoising. Any thoughts or advice? Does the boat need wedges? Do you suggest different props. It is an excellent boat and rides well but we need to get the RPM and porpoising issues solved. Thank you for all of your help.

456,The standard macerators we use are a blade discharging system; however we have installed the Whale diaphragm fish box macerator on one of our 375TE. They seem to like that pump and have made several positive comments about the product. Going this route would eliminate the need to install an additional thru hull for discharging; the pump would just be spliced into the existing hose. Here is a link to the Whale macerator website. I hope this information will help you make your decision a bit easier. Thank you again for using our forum.

470,I just bought a 339 and live up North (Cape) and need to winterize.  Any hints / tips / gottchas / gouge so I am not surprised in the Spring?,===MARK===
471,"Hi, The key to winterizing is to make sure that all fresh and saltwater is evacuated from all systems.  It's good to use air to blow out the freshwater lines, air conditioning and generator systems need to have anti-freeze added to all water passages.  Low spots where ware might lie are something to consider as well.  Let us know if this short guide to winterizing helps. Regards, Joe Brenna",===MARK===
472,"I spent the afternoon with my neighbor who has great experience and understanding of winterizing.  We removed the hose before it goes into the A/C cooling pump under the steps and ran pink RV anti freeze (AF)  into it and then started the system and waited until the AF was shooting out of the discharge on port overboard flow.  Need to wet vac out strainer and open A/C valve to seawater once out of the water.  Also ran freshwater tank dry from washdown silcock and filled with 5 gal of AF and ran sink and shower lines until AF came out and sent most of discharge into the head and drains.  Pumped out holding tank and then ran AF from head into holding tank.  Still need to open up ball valves in aft compartment and for head to let seawater drain and then run AF through drains and seawater pump.  I think that I should also remove the feeder pipe from the front of the head and suck up AF to run thru the pump and into the bowl instead of just running it thru the bowl and out the discharge line(s).  Not sure what ""Y"" valve does for head - would guess that one position goes directly overboard and the other goes to the holding tank.  I can flush with valve in either position, just to be safe.

As you recommended, blowing out the lines is fine, once they are filled and purged with AF.  I know that you are in FL and may have a lot of experience with winterizing but I wanted to share with you what we did and have you think about where we might be missing something.    ",===MARK===

492,"What are the weight limitations for the dive door, and can they be increased through upgraded hardware?",===MARK===
493,"Thanks for your inquiry.  We have developed the dive door systems on our boats throughout the years to accommodate reasonable loads.  There are aluminum plates in the laminate schedule into which the bolts that hold the hinges are fastened.  The bolt patterns are arranged on the hinges so that they match up to these plates.  Not sure how much more capacity you want to add, but my thought is that the current design should be of enough capacity to allow a diver with a reasonable amount of gear to enter the boat using our dive door ladder.  Adding capacity for whatever reason is certainly possible, but would fall into the realm of custom options, these are best designed and fabricated before and during the construction process.  We are at the Miami Boat Show for the next week or so but I'll welcome a call from you to discuss once I get back to the office next week.  My number is (727) 548-1260 ext. 229.

I've been all over various marine supply houses and websites to no avail.

This is for a 322 Cuddy from 1998.

Spoke with someone at Intrepid who suggested Perko.

So I gambled and ordered one Perko 07778F01CHR at $150 including shipping.
I need several but didn't want to get a whole lot at once in case they didn't work
out.  

Good thing I only got one because it is too small and doesn't cover the hole/cutout

make and not the more appropriately shaped rectangular model.

So now I'm stuck with a $150 paperweight/doorstop and still my deck is still
full of holes.   [:(]  

Surely there are older Intrepids out there with proper hatch dogs.  Are they
all still using OEM plastic hatch dogs that are uncracked/unbroken?  I doubt
that very much.  I find it hard to believe mine are the only ones that have
cracked/broken and need replacement.

Does anyone have any idea where to get these apparently extremely hard-to-find
replacement hatch dogs for older model Intrepids?

Hey, many thanks PH4.  That Marcus fellow sounds like a real stand up guy.  I will definitely be looking into the Gemlux product especially if he's helpful in providing samples beforehand.  I don't need anymore paperweights.

Oddly enough, another fellow on THT going by 'boat22' recently restored his 1997 model and used the square 2.5"" Taco F16-2525 stainless latches which also said covered the holes.  He started his project and posted that info after I did all my research and talking with Intrepid.  So I guess I thought Perko was the only game in town for hatch dogs.  I came across his THT post yesterday after posting here.

So now I have two leads to pursue.  I'm going to look into both and will update this thread later (or maybe put it out on THT if my Intrepid profile gets deleted again) with my results so that others may know what their options are.

That's pretty amazing the assistance you got from everyone at Intrepid.  I've heard a lot about that from others as well.  I won't win any points with them for posting this but that has not been my experience unfortunately.  (Hence, the paperweight...)  At least the hulls are solid, though.

Very nice job on your restore, BTW.  And thanks again!

Hello Joe,

     We use a 3M neoprene gasket for the dive door; there are two different types that we use. a 1/4"" flat gasket that seals the bottom edge where the hinges are and a D shaped gasket for the sides. We carry this gasket here at the factory. You can contact Walt Putman in Customer Service (727) 548-1260 ext. 242 - customercare@intrepidpowerboats.com or myself Paul Fleming Warranty Service Manager (727) 385-9335 - warranty@intrepidpowerboats.com.

Promise I have no affiliation with Intrepid just impressed and thankful for their help. Maybe give them another ring.

I have a brochure that shows the tank size at 245 gal. for the main and 50 gal. for the auxiliary tank.
The deck fill plates typically mimic the arrangement of how the tanks are in the hull with the aux. tank forward and the main tank aft.
Your zinc's are bolted into the hull. This is why the bolt just spins. You should look inside and remove any nuts holding wires.
The fasteners used for the swim platform braces are #14 screws for the bottom into the hull and 1/4 - 20 bolts up at the platform itself.
Let me know if you have any more questions. Thanks,

517,"Hi Joe,

I have a 2005 30' centre console with twin verado 250's. It spends most of the time in the water and is only on the trailer for service etc.  I have recently had the bunks on my trailer replaced.  It looks as though the new bunks do not have the change in level the old ones used to have (for the step in the hull).  The service provider lifted the boat onto the trailer and said it was fine.  If the bunks are flat will this cause a structural problem/stress on the hull when it is on the trailer?

Thanks for the advice.

Brian",===MARK===
518,"Hi Brian, 

Thanks for your post.  If there is no difference in the height of the bunk you run the risk of point loading the bottom of the boat at the step.  Basically this means that the weight of the boat will be concentrated on the step area of the hull and could cause problems in the long term. I can send you a drawing that will act as a guide to setting up the trailer.  Call or email me at the office and we can figure it out.  Regards,  Joe Brenna ",===MARK===
519,"Thanks Joe, that is what I was worried about.  I will give you a call and would appreciate the drawing.  They have already put the new (flat) bunks on but depending on what you think they may be able to either shave the forward portion or add a layer for height to the rear portion.  I did take a look at photos I have of the old bunks and there is a definite height change where the step sits on the bunks.

556,Try contacting Ken at PropGod. http://www.propgods.com/Content2/Default.aspx

557,"Hi,
The plastic clips come with the unit which is manufactured by Dometic Corp ( dometic.com ).They have both a dealer look up page and a contact page. 
I would suggest leaving your message and contact information on the contact page and see if they will just send you some. 
Plan “B” might be to find a dealer in your local area to see if they have some in hand.
These clips are attached to the vent when it comes to Intrepid so we have never had any loose ones. If you strike out on either of the other plans let me know and I will see if I can round some up for you.
In the mean time I would suggest taping the vent closed. The idea is to prevent damage but not shut off the air flow. If seeing tape is too much you could try wedging it shut with some folded paper or something of that nature.
Thanks,
Walt

558,I actually did consult with Ken a few weeks ago and he was very helpful in guidance. Unfortunately being in Jersey I could not directly benefit from him direct attention.  He did provide some history and data of re-propping a 377 but most experience with Verados.  Seems the main finding was mounting level and he found many were mounted a bit low impacting performance.

I am making progress and was fortunate to have a dealer that has a selection of props to work with.  I am currently working with the Rebel 15 1/2 x 17 and seems to be the right combination.  I am getting much better mid range performance and economy without loosing top end speed.

Thanks for your reply and agree that Propgods is a great resource.  I would definitely use Ken if I lived in Florida.,===MARK===

It didn't last long, and I'm curious whether that was because the shorter length and wide beam (9'2"") turned out a less Intrepid-worthy ride? The build quality is everything I expected (impeccable), but am wondering what else to look for. 

Is it a shortened version of the 289 open from that time period? ",===MARK===

Being wider than the 246 I owned previously, I wonder fi the boat will ride as well, especially in a head sea. How has the ride been in your experience offshore?

Also, I have not owned a step hulled boat. I understand some have funny characteristics at speed, especially in turns. Have you experienced anything I should be watch for in the sea trial?

What power does yours have? I am interested in your speed and rpms at wide open throttle, as well as your cruise speed, rpms, and fuel burn at cruise. This boat is rigged with 200 hp HPDIs, and is a bit slower than I would have guessed.",===MARK===

It's got some options to consider for repairs, depending on how extensive and how perfect you want the solution to be. ",===MARK===
569,"The paint on the hull side of your boat is more than likely a DuPont Imron product. It is not available from the Intrepid factory but is available from a Finishmaster store that offers DuPont products, possibly in your area. They will also have the tools needed to get a good color match. If you are experienced in applying this paint that is all you need. If not you are going to need a professional to do the actual work.
If you will email me (there is a link to email me directly) your vessel’s serial number I will be glad to look through any records the factory has to find the paint codes for the paint. If you will let me know where you (the boat) are I can also see who we can suggest might be the best to apply the paint.
The carpet for your boat was an item in an interiors selection from a group of selections offered by the factory at the time your boat was built. We had a designer develop several arrangements. These arrangements were offered during the configuration process for the boats shop order. 
It seems the fabric business will develop and offer specific fabrics and materials for a “season”. They guess at how much of each material will be used and they produce that amount. During the season they may run more material if need be. Next season, new items are developed and offered repeating the process. Basically what I’m saying here is your carpet is most likely not available (produced any longer). This fact kind of eases the issue in that you are no longer looking for a specific item. You or maybe your wife (it’s always a great thing to get the ladies involved any way you can!) are free to shop for new carpet that matches your interior from what’s available today. Once you find what you like you can use the old carpet as a pattern. Most automotive upholstery shops will have a binding material to capture (bind) the edges. After that the old carpet becomes a guide for snap placement. You will let the snaps in the floor be the final say on where each snap goes.

Walt",===MARK===
570,"Did Intrepid make a 262 in 2000? I found the AD for that boat, it looks more like a pre-1998 hull. Did it have a stepped bottom?",===MARK===
571,"Yeah, it has the wider hull, step, and later cap style. I had an earlier 246 and this was definitely a newer style. ",===MARK===
572,"Thank You all for assistance. The link to the Hull Truth helpful and I think I can do the repair myself. It is a small area that I notice more than anyone else---typical. The surface may not be professional grade, but with a brush and the correct color match, it won't be nearly as noticeable and I can stop beating myself up about misjudging the current when pulling out of a slip.
  Also, found out Snap-In Carpet company will make custom marine snap in carpets for any boat. Just ship them the carpet (or a tracing) to use as a template. They have good color selection.

573,Apparently the newer rub rail end caps are larger than what is on my 2007 310 W/A. Todd was gracious enough to give me a set of the current rub rail caps and they are clearly much larger than mine. Also the end caps at the dive door are different than the two on the stern. There is a total of 6 end caps - 1 each port and starboard stern and 4 at the dive door which are different from the stern caps. Anyone have any idea where I can find a complete set of end caps?,===MARK===
574,"The first rub rail end caps were made from a solid piece of starboard. The piece was 3/8” thick and a large square. The whole thing was hand fit.
What Todd gave you is all that is currently available. It’s made on our CNC router machine. The curved shapes match that of the rub rail molding. The straight part has to be brought down so the curved end touches the curves of the molding and insert. The ends are purposefully taller than what’s needed so the installer can custom fit them to eliminate any gaps. At least with the new end caps you only have to fit the edge that goes against the hull (half the work). Send me an email (link is below) with what you need now.

596,I own a 377 intrepid with 3 suzuki DF300 engines. Currently I have 3 propellers with three blades (pitch 20) these are the original props that came with the engines. Currently the fuel efficiency is very bad and also I dont have that much top speed. Another problem that I have is that I want to change from a solid hub propeller to a interchangeable hub propeller. Can anyone recommend a specific propeller and also tell me if I can combine a 4 blade propeller in the center engine and 3 blade propellers for the right and left engine. Will these improve my fuel efficiency and my top speed?

600,"Greg,

I emailed you a response. I'm copying it here for others benefit and hopefully owners with f225's /f250's will share some insight into how they have handled the clearance issue while the motors are tilted up and turned - 

I went from 225 ox66's to f-225's figuring it would be a simple swap as the rigging is the same and the gauges are compatible with a simple indexing change on DIP switches on the back of the units. Plus I got a good deal on some super low hour post corrosion issue engines.

A simple swap has had some issues that we've overcome. The big thing is the on center mounting distance change that you mentioned. This has presented a few issues -

Moving the engines out the required dimension meant that the engine bracket now covered the splash well scupper drains on the exterior. The interior splash well has those nice recesses molded in to allow complete draining and I didn't want to change that. So, new ones where drilled using the original inside opening but angled out at a 45' angle and glassed in some 1"" tube. Issue addressed and it now has a larger drain. 

New hydraulic rams and mounting brackets were needed and I needed to ""flip"" the hydraulic hoses 180' to allow clearances.

The biggest problem I foresee is the fact that we will have to be aware of engine position when tilting up. If they are turned at an angle, say hard to left, the left engine cover will hit the corner of the port stern locker at about 3/4 of the way or more tilted up and vice versa. I may try to fabricate a limit switch that will now allow the engines to tilt if the steering rams are fully extended in either direction.

I'm a week from being on the water (currently just stopped snowing here in SE CT) and will see how this goes.

I would look hard at engines that have the narrowest mounting centers and carefully consider the options. Good luck, I hope my experience has helped.

602,"Chanie - Sorry for the late response...I couldn't find my login info, so I just created a new account.  I just repainted my Intrepid 31' WA with West Marine's PCA Gold Premium Ablative Antifouling Paint.  I'm no expert so I did some research, asked many of the local marinas up here in NC and they all agreed that this paint was the best for the money.  I was told this ablative type paint is for boats that will be used/run...i.e. running the boat removes any growth and a microscopic ""layer"" of the paint.  I sanded the old paint for a couple hours - just to remove the rough spots and minimize buildup, I then removed the dust with a rag and paint thinner.  Then taped the water line and went to painting.  I did notice that the paint wasn't mixed well even after West Marine shook it up with machine, so I had them do it several more times for each gallon I purchased.  This was my first time doing it myself, but so far, I'm well pleased and it saved me about $300-$400.  Hope this helps!  James",===MARK===

628,"Ronald Leary has requested a trade from the Dallas Cowboys and has been a no-show for the offseason program, including the start of organized team activities Tuesday, according to sources.


Leary signed [url=http://www.atlantafalconsjerseyspop.com/]Atlanta Falcons Jerseys[/url] his restricted free-agent tender worth $2.553 million before the draft in hopes of facilitating a trade. Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said the team received a few inquiries during the three-day draft but they would not just “give away” Leary. He is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent after the season.


The only part of the offseason program that is mandatory for players to attend is the June minicamp. If Leary does [url=http://www.atlantafalconsjerseyspop.com/]cheap NFL Jerseys[/url] not show up for the camp, he would be subject to a fine because he signed the tender.


The Tennessee Titans lost left guard Byron Bell on Tuesday for the season because of a dislocated ankle. Earlier this offseason, the Titans traded for DeMarco Murray, whom Leary helped run for an NFL-high 1,845 yards in 2014.


Leary started every game he played in 2013 and 2014 (31) at left guard and opened [url=http://www.atlantafalconsjerseyspop.com/]Wholesale Atlanta Falcons Jerseys[/url] last season as the starter but was eventually replaced by La’el Collins, who signed a fully-guaranteed contract as an undrafted rookie. Leary started four games and was inactive for 12.


Leary is looking at a backup role again in 2016 and the Cowboys signed Joe Looney [url=http://www.atlantafalconsjerseyspop.com/]Wholesale NFL Jerseys[/url] as a backup guard/center to replace Mackenzy Bernadeau, who left as a free agent this offseason with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Since Leary does not have any center experience, he would likely be inactive on game day since the Cowboys generally dress only seven offensive linemen on the 46-man roster.


Leary joined the Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2012, receiving more than $200,000 guaranteed. He spent that season on the practice squad before becoming a starter in 2013.

647,"[url=http://www.atlantafalconsjerseyspop.com/]Wholesale NFL Jerseys[/url] Sources: Ronald Leary has requested trade from Cowboys

Ronald Leary has requested a trade from the Dallas Cowboys and has been a no-show for the offseason program, including the start of organized team activities Tuesday, according to sources. [url=http://www.atlantafalconsjerseyspop.com/]Atlanta Falcons Jerseys[/url] 

Leary signed his restricted free-agent tender worth $2.553 million before the draft in hopes of facilitating a trade. Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said the team received a few inquiries during the three-day draft but they would not just “give away” Leary. He is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent after the season.

[url=http://www.atlantafalconsjerseyspop.com/]Wholesale Atlanta Falcons Jerseys[/url] The only part of the offseason program that is mandatory for players to attend is the June minicamp. If Leary does not show up for the camp, he would be subject to a fine because he signed the tender.

The Tennessee Titans lost left guard Byron Bell on Tuesday for the season because of a dislocated ankle. Earlier this offseason, the Titans traded for DeMarco Murray, whom Leary helped run for an NFL-high 1,845 yards in 2014.

Leary started every game he played in 2013 and 2014 (31) at left guard and opened last season as the starter but was eventually replaced by La’el Collins, who signed a fully-guaranteed contract as an undrafted rookie. Leary started four games and was inactive for 12.

Leary is looking at a backup role again in 2016 and the Cowboys signed Joe Looney as a backup guard/center to replace Mackenzy Bernadeau, who left as a free agent this offseason with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Since Leary does not have any center experience, he would likely be inactive on game day since the Cowboys generally dress only seven offensive linemen on the 46-man roster.

[url=http://www.atlantafalconsjerseyspop.com/]cheap NFL Jerseys[/url] Leary joined the Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2012, receiving more than $200,000 guaranteed. He spent that season on the practice squad before becoming a starter in 2013.

We all want to have good things in our lives. Yet we do not work in ways that will bring about the things that we want in our hearts. We can have a desire and expectation of those things but there are blocks on the road.

These blocks are the major reasons we do not find ourselves in the prosperity or receiving the promises of our Creator. These things that we place on our road are truly made of our own doing. These are the anchors that weigh us down so that what we wish to occur in our lives will not aid in our own transformation.

Anger, envy, jealousy and malice will not allow us to move on in any area of our lives. These negative thoughts that will always act out in our behaviors will block our road to peace, health and prosperity. Inclusive of these emotions and thoughts is also the lack of faith and forgiveness.

On the second day of the Minnesota Vikings' organized team activities, Blair Walsh drilled all five field goals he attempted in the team's indoor practice facility. Speaking to reporters after the Wednesday session, Walsh said he has closed the door on the frigid miss that ended the Vikings' 2015 season.

Walsh, who pulled a 27-yard field goal wide left in the final seconds of the Vikings' 10-9 wild-card loss to the Seattle Seahawks, said he's not thinking about the miss on a daily basis anymore. He has a simple reply for those who bring up the kick to him.

""My common message is, it's one moment,"" Walsh said. ""It won't define me.""

Walsh, who hit 34 of his 39 regular-season field goal attempts in 2015, was the subject of national attention in the days following the game, both for the miss and the way he handled the aftermath. A [url=http://www.wholesalejerseysgests.com/]wholesale jerseys[/url] first-grade class in Blaine, Minnesota, sent Walsh letters of support after the game; Walsh postponed his flight out of the Twin Cities so he could meet with the students and thank them in person for their kindness.

He will play in the first season of the four-year contract extension he signed last July, and will again kick indoors at home. The Vikings will move into U.S. Bank Stadium this fall after two years at [url=http://www.wholesalejerseysgest.com/]wholesale NFL jerseys[/url] TCF Bank Stadium, where the temperature was minus-6 at kickoff for the playoff loss to Seattle.

Though he said he thought 2015 was one of his best years, Walsh isn't pining for a return to [url=http://www.wholesalejerseysband.com/]wholesale NFL jerseys[/url] the outdoors.

""I'm not going to lie to [url=http://www.wholesalejerseysgest.com/]wholesale jerseys[/url] you and tell you it's easier to kick at TCF than it is inside,"" Walsh said. ""You can take the elements out of it and focus on your form and your craft. You can forget about, 'Hey, man, it's minus-10 out today.' You get to go in there and act like it's a normal day outside.""

In Hollywood terms, add a United Nations mix of ingredients and you have the blockbuster Life of Pi. With 11 Academy Awards nominations second only to Lincoln with 12 and the sort of global box office receipts normally reserved for superheroes, Life of Pi is one of the most unusual megahits ever to hit the big screen. Approaching $600 million at the box office worldwide, the film is by far the top grosser among the nine best picture nominees with $200 million more than Les Miserables and Django Unchained, its closest rivals. Life of Pi has action, suspense and spectacle, but it’s a thoughtful, contemplative, internalized film, a philosophical and even cryptic story that touched something in the worldwide psyche resulting in business in the realm of more traditional Hollywood hits such as The Hunger Games.

Men in [url=http://www.trainerlife.co.uk/nike-air-max-1]nike air max 1 sale[/url] Black 3 and Brave. Though backed by 20th Century Fox, the film has an international sensibility that Life of Pi director Ang Lee hopes will gradually become part of everyday business in Hollywood, which has a long history of telling tales even overseas ones with an American perspective. “It’s a global movie culture. The mainstream cinematic language was largely set up by Hollywood, Americans, therefore it’s American. Some European directors, but it was an American spirit, ” Lee said. “I think the film language that’s established here, that’s the biggest obstacle when you try to do something different. You know, the world views things differently. They have different life experiences. ”As does the talent behind Life of [url=http://www.trainerlife.co.uk/nike-air-force-1]cheap nike air force 1[/url] Pi.

Lee grew up in Taiwan, went to film school at New York University and has become one of Hollywood’s most eclectic filmmakers, turning his martial arts epic Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon into a critical and commercial smash and winning the best director Oscar for Brokeback Mountain. The film’s largely Indian cast is led by newcomer Suraj Sharma as teenage Pi Patel and Irrfan Khan as adult Pi, with French superstar Gerard Depardieu and British actor Rafe Spall co starring.

“But it’s a big, beautiful world out there, and when you deliver a film that has the strength of [url=http://www.trainerlife.co.uk/nike-air-max-90]nike air max 90 sale[/url] story, the emotionality, the spirituality and the spectacle of a film like ‘Pi, ’ people show up. ”Hollywood studios once counted on domestic audiences for most of a movie’s revenue. But overseas markets have been Hollywood’s growth area, with international audiences now accounting for two thirds or more of receipts on many films. The ratio is even higher on Life of Pi, which has taken in a respectable $108. 5 million domestically but a remarkable $460 million four fifths of its total from overseas fans. That includes $90. 8 million in China, $45. 4 million in Great Britain, $29. 9 million in Russia and $19. 8 million in Mexico.

Slumdog too Nike Factory k in $377 million worldwide and won the 2008 bes Nike Factory t picture Oscar. Two such films don’t constitute a new wave of Hollywood openness to foreign flavors, though. “Remember after the success of Slumdog, there was a lot of talk of a lot more films like that set in similar locations, and it just didn’t happen, ” said Nitin Govil, assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s School of [url=http://www.trainerlife.co.uk/nike-air-foamposite-one]nike air foamposite one[/url] Cinematic Arts.

“Anytime you get a success like this, there’s an attempt to kind of genericize it. But the thing that makes these successful is that they’re singular. Maybe not one offs, but certainly not formulaic. ”And Hollywood remains a formulaic place, with stories mostly reflecting American tastes.
